# Turtle-Crossing-game
Turtle Crossing is a fun and challenging game built using Python and the Turtle module. The objective of the game is to help the turtle safely cross a busy road filled with moving cars. The player must navigate the turtle across the screen, avoiding collisions with the cars, and reach the other side.

Features:

1. Game setup: The game window is set to a size of 600x600 pixels, providing a suitable canvas for gameplay. The title of the game is "Turtle Crossing".

2. Player control: The player controls a turtle object using the up arrow key. By pressing the up arrow key, the turtle moves forward, trying to cross the road and reach the finish line.

3. Car movement: Cars are generated randomly on the screen and move from right to left. The speed of the cars gradually increases as the player progresses through the levels.

4. Collision detection: The game checks for collisions between the turtle and the cars. If a collision occurs, the game is over, and the player loses. The game displays a "GAME OVER" message on the screen.

5. Levels and scoring: The game keeps track of the player's progress with a level system. Each time the turtle successfully crosses the road, the level increases, and the car speed becomes faster. The current level is displayed on the screen.

To play the game, run the script and use the up arrow key to control the turtle. Your goal is to safely guide the turtle across the road, avoiding collisions with the moving cars. Try to reach higher levels and achieve a high score.

Enjoy playing Turtle Crossing and have fun challenging yourself to cross the road safely!
